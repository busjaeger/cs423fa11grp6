Case Study 2: Multiprogramming

observation:
total cpu utilization increases as N increases (fourth graph)



observation:
(completion time, figure this out by looking at how many profiled reads for each? N = 1, 402 reads; N = 5, 410 reads; N = 11 419 reads)



observation:
cpu utilization starts out high and then tapers; when N = 5 and N = 11, cpu utilization spikes at the end (why?)



observation:
no major page faults
